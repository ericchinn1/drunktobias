<p>At the helm of Drunk Tobias Brewing stands Peyton Ulrich, a young man passionate about beer, brewing, and the Drunk Tobias lifestyle. Peyton’s life in beer started at a young age, when he was introduced to craft beer through festivals and brewery tours throughout his hometown of Seattle, Washington and the greater world.
<br>
<br>
He got his start in brewing at The Palm Shack in San Luis Obispo, California, where alongside Co-Founder Tony Bellanti he helped lead the creation of local favorites such as The Rusty Cutter West Coast IPA, Grandpa’s Toenails Hazy IPA, and The Communist Manifesto Russian Imperial Stout.
<br>
<br>
After relocating his body and soul to Santa Rosa, California, he decided to embark on a solo endeavor, and Drunk Tobias Brewing was born. At DTB, Peyton aims to provide a wide variety of offerings to his followers, including traditional European styles, dry and delicate Hazy IPAs, and adjunct-laden ales showcasing Sonoma County’s bountiful seasonal harvests.<br>
<br>
When he is not busy mashing, sparging, boiling, or bottling, you can find Peyton at your local beer garden, ballpark, or concert hall.</p>
